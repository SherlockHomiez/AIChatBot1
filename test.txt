All fabrics are obtained from fibres, while fibres are obtained from artificial or man-made sources.  They consist of a small unit or a polymer which is made from many repeating units known as monomers. They include nylon, acrylics, polyurethane, and polypropylene. Millions of tons of these fibres are produced all over the world each year.Following are some of the most commonly used synthetic fibres: Know more about Classifications of FibersThe modern textile industry is unthinkable today without synthetic fibres. Man-made fibres like silk have always been greatly valued for their gloss and fineness. Man-made fibres are smooth. They can be distinguished by looking at a cross-section. Some synthetic fibres are listed below.This fibre finds its applications in household articles like ropes, bucket, furniture, etc.Synthetic fibres are made from small molecules synthesized polymers. The substances used to produce such fibres are extracted from raw materials such as chemicals based on petroleum or petrochemicals. Such materials are polymerized into a chemical that ties together two adjacent atoms of carbon.It is used in the manufacture of ropes, nets for fishing and seat belts. Polyester – This fabric is made from coal and oil and is wrinkle-free and easy to clean. It is used for the production of caps, raincoats, and ropes.Like natural fibres, synthetic fibres do not easily take up colours. These fibres can burn faster than natural fibres. They are prone to damage to heat and easily melt.For example, man-made synthetic fibres such as rayon, nylon, acrylic, etc. A Synthetic Fiber is a string of a combination of small units of chemical substance.Synthetic fibres are more durable: they have bright wear and tear resistance. Because of this, synthetic fibre fabric is very durable. Such fibres have a high lustre, and with age, they don’t turn yellow.To follow more about synthetic fibre, download BYJU’S – The Learning App.Read more:

Agriculture is the science, which mainly deals with the diverse processes or the methods used for the cultivating different varieties of plants and livestock farming or animal husbandry on the basis of human requirements.When plants of the same variety are cultivated on a large scale, they are called crops. The crops are divided on the basis of the seasons in which they grow:Kharif Crops-These crops are sown in the early monsoon season, which generally varies by crop and region of cultivation. In India, Kharif crops are sown at the beginning of the rainy season, between the month of June and July. These crops are harvested at the end of monsoon season,  between the month of September and October. Paddy is the main Kharif crop.Rabi Crops- These crops are sown during winter and after the monsoon, which is between the month of October and November. In India, Rabi crops are harvested during the spring between the month of March and April. Wheat is the main Rabi crop.Table of Contents:Read on to explore the production and management of crops in detail.About 70% of the Indian population practices agriculture. Hence, the production and management of crops is an important aspect to ensure optimal productivity in the fields. The major agricultural practices involved in crop production and management are listed below:The soil is loosened and tilted before the seeds are sown. Ploughs are used for the purpose. If the soil contains big lumps, they are broken with the help of a hoe. This process aerates the soil so that the roots breathe easily. The nutrients and minerals get properly mixed with the soil and come at the top. Thus, the fertility of the soil increases and is fit for plantation.The good quality, infection-free seeds are collected and sown on the prepared land. The seeds should be sown at proper depths and proper distances. Following are the various methods used to sow the seeds:The soil may not have the right nutrients to efficiently sustain plant growth. Hence, manures and fertilizers are added to the soil to increase its fertility and help plants grow better. Manure is prepared by using decomposing plant and animal matter in compost pits. Fertilizers, on the other hand, are chemicals prepared in factories which contain nutrients for a specific plant. They give faster results than manures. However, when excessively used, they turn the soil infertile.Crops require water at regular intervals for proper growth. The supply of water to the plants is known as irrigation. Well, rivers, lakes, tube-wells are different sources for irrigation. The traditional methods of agriculture involve the use of humans and animals. The various traditional ways are moats, chain-pump, dhekli, rahat.The modern techniques of irrigation include the sprinkler system and the drip system. Water is very important for the germination of seeds. It helps in the proper development of flowers, fruits, seeds, and plants. Therefore, it should be present in plants in large quantities.The undesirable plants that grow along with the crops are called weeds. These weeds, feed on the nutrients provided to the crops and thus reduce the supply of nutrients to the crops, thereby, inhibiting their growth. The growth of these weeds needs to be prevented in order to enhance the growth of the plants.The process of removal of weeds is called weeding. To achieve this, weedicides are employed, which are essentially chemicals specifically made to destroy weeds. They are usually sprayed before seeding and flowering.When the crop matures, it is cut for further processing. This process is known as harvesting. It is usually manual labour, done with the help of sickle. However, mechanical harvesting is used these days – machines such as combine harvesters are used where the crops are harvested and threshed in one go.The grains should be properly stored if they are to be kept for longer periods. They need to be protected from pests and moisture. The freshly harvested seeds should be dried before they are stored. This prevents the attack from microorganisms and pests.The harvested and separated grains are stored in airtight metallic bins or in the jute bags. Dried neem leaves are added to protect them from damage at home. Large amounts of grains are stored in granaries or silos with specific chemical treatments, to protect them from pests and insects.Animals are an important source of food. The rearing of animals for food is known as animal husbandry. Some animals like cows and buffaloes are reared for milk, others for meat like goats and poultry. Some people consume fish as a part of their diet. Honey bees are reared for honey. Thus, animals are an integral source of food and food products.To explore more concepts on Crop Production and Management, or any other related topics, please register at BYJU’S.Related LinksThe steps involved in crop production include:The factors that control crop production include:Crop production supports the huge population of a country. All individuals depend on the crops for their food. It also provides employment to a large number of people.

It is done either mechanically or by cattle.Winnowing- The separation of grains and chaff is called winnowing. It is done either mechanically or manually.The entire world depends on agriculture for its food. Therefore, it is very important to produce and store the harvested crops carefully.The soil should be loosened and aerated properly during crop production.Manures and fertilizers need to be added carefully. Too much fertilizer damages the soil while too little makes the crop deficient in nutrients.The crops should be irrigated periodically.The unwanted plants should be removed from the cultivated fields. These plants absorb the nutrients provided to the crop and obstruct their growth and development.The matured crops are harvested mechanically or manually.The harvested grains are dried and stored to protect them from pests and pathogens.

Microbiology is the study of a variety of living organisms which are invisible to the naked eye like bacteria and fungi and many other microscopic organisms. Although tiny in size these organisms form the basis for all life on earth. These microbes are also known to produce the soil in which plants grow and fix the atmospheric gases that both plants and animals use. About 3 billion years ago at the time of the formation of the earth, microbes were the only lives on earth. Microorganisms have played a key role in the evolution of the planet earth. The history and scope of microbiology is a diverse topic which will be discussed later in detail.Microorganisms affect animals, the environment, the food supply and also the healthcare industry. There are many different areas of microbiology including environmental, veterinary, food, pharmaceutical and medical microbiology, which is the most prominent.Microorganisms are very important to the environment, human health and the economy. Few have immense beneficial effects without which we could not exist. Others are really harmful, and our effort to overcome their effects tests our understanding and skills. The uses of microbiology can be beneficial or harmful depending on what we require from them.Disease and decay are neither inherent properties of organic objects, nor are caused by physical damage, it is microorganisms that bring about these changes. We are surrounded by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Many microorganisms cause diseases in cattle, crops and others are known for entering human bodies and causing various diseases.Examples of familiar human diseases are:Bacteria: pneumonia, bacterial dysentery, diphtheria, bubonic plague, meningitis, typhoid, cholera, salmonella, meningococcalVirus:  Chickenpox, measles, mumps, German measles, colds, warts, cold sores, influenzaProtozoa: amoebic dysentery, malaria,Fungi: ringworm, athlete’s footAs decomposers, bacteria and fungi play an important role in an ecosystem. They break down dead or waste organic matter and release inorganic molecules. Green plants take these nutrients which are in turn consumed by animals, and the products of these plants and animals are again broken down by decomposers.Yeast is a single-celled fungus that lives naturally on the surface of the fruit. It is economically important in bread-making and brewing beer and also in the making of yoghurt.Most microorganisms are unicellular; if they are multicellular, they lack highly differentiated tissues.There are fundamentally two different types of cells, One being Prokaryotic and the other EukaryoticMicrobes especially prokaryotes are numerous in number in comparison to eukaryotes.The lineage of life on Earth originated from these microbes:1. Bacteria2. Archaea3. EucaryaThere are various different branches of microbiology and these include the following:1. Bacteriology- The study of bacteria2. Mycology –The study of fungi3. Phycology- The study of photosynthetic eukaryotes. (Algae- Seaweed)4. Protozoology – The study of protozoa (Single-celled eukaryotes)5. Virology- The study of viruses, non-cellular particles which parasitize cells.6. Parasitology- The study of parasites which include pathogenic protozoa certain insects and helminth worms.7. Nematology- The study of nematodes.Stay tuned with BYJU’S to learn more about Microbiology and its importance.Medical microbiology can be defined as a branch of microbiology that deals with the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.The time between 1850 to 1915 is considered as the golden era of microbiology.In nursing, microbiology helps the professionals to understand the interaction between humans and microbes. It also helps in understanding the basic morphology, reproductive and biochemical properties of microorganisms.Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch gave the germ theory of disease and Koch’s postulates, which was a big contribution to the beginning of microbiology.


There are so many materials catering to our various needs on a daily basis. We drink water, eat food, breathe air, go to school, etc. All these things are available to us, but are all free of cost and readily accessible without fear of being depleted one day.No. Not everything is readily available to us. For instance, sunlight, air, etc are resources which we find in abundance and it won’t be depleted any time soon. Hence, these resources are called Inexhaustible natural resources.Other resources are created in very limited quantities and it takes a very long time for such resources to be replenished. Such resources are known as exhaustible natural resources. Ex: coal, petroleum, minerals, natural gas, etc.Let us briefly understand a few of these exhaustible natural resources.Also, read Sustainability of Natural ResourcesCoal and petroleum are formed as a result of degradation of ancient plant life which lived millions of years ago. These dead plant matter started to pile up, eventually forming a substance called peat. Over time, heat and pressure from geological processes transformed these materials into coal. Since these are formed from essentially fossils, they are also known as fossil fuels.Formation of coal dates back to millions of years ago, when the earth was covered only with vast moist forests, having huge trees, shrubs, ferns, etc. These plants underwent their life cycle and withered away, eventually falling back to the ground, most of which were swamps. New plants replaced them, they underwent a life cycle and the whole process continued repeatedly over the years, as a result of which the earth bed started accumulating all these dead plants.This gave rise to a very thick layer of dead decomposed matter packing down plant matter washing away all the decayed matter. Physical and chemical changes took place as a result of heat and temperature extracting out all oxygen leaving the plant layers with carbon-rich content, thus resulting in the formation of coal over a period of time.Also, read ForestsCoal is a readily combustible rock containing more than 50% by weight of carbon.Coal formed can be of three types depending on the amount of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen they contain. They are:Petroleum is a fossil fuel that naturally occurs in the liquid form created by the decomposition of organic matter beneath the surface of the earth millions of years ago. These fossil fuels are then refined into usable substances such as petrol, kerosene, etc. It is formed by the combination of hydrocarbons and other substances, mainly sulphur. When first collected in its natural form, it is termed as crude oil. This substance is generally characterized by a brownish-black colour. Although, it can also differ between red to pale yellow or even colourless. Its thickness (viscosity) varies from nearly solid tar-like consistency to low viscosity, almost like water.Refining petroleum thus obtained yields many useful products. Let’s have a look at them.Petroleum products are obtained as a result of refining crude oil in oil refineries. There are numerous products that are created from petroleum and its by-products. A study reveals that by-products of petroleum alone provides scope to obtain 6000+ new products, to name a few, fertilizers, perfumes, flooring, insecticides, soaps, vitamins, petroleum jelly, etc.A few of the products obtained from petroleum are:Petroleum is one of the most important and widely used fuels in today’s time.

Combustion is defined as a rapid exothermic reaction that liberates substantial energy as heat and flames as combustion reactions with the ability to propagate through a suitable medium.Actually, combustion is a result of dynamic or time dependent events that occur on a molecular level among atoms, molecules, radicals and solid boundaries. Combustion generates air pollution, pollutant formation and oxidation kinetics as well as their reduction techniques are explained in this chapter.There are three necessary conditions for combustion. These areSubstances that produce heat on combustion are called combustion fuels. In many rural parts of our country people still use wood as a fuel because of its easy availability and low cost. Global warming is the result of an increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere mostly due to the combustion of fuels.There are three types of natural flames, which are carburized flames and oxidising flames. Natural flame has a balance fuel-oxygen combination, carburizing flame has more fuel and oxidising flame has more oxygen. Based on the welding state various materials used various flames.Combustion is a chemical reaction where a material quickly reacts with oxygen and gives off heat. The initial material is called a gasoline, and the oxidizer is considered the source of oxygen. The fuel may be a solid, liquid, or gas, although the fuel is typically a liquid for airplane propulsion.The candle flame’s inner centre is light violet, with a temperature of around 1800 K (1500 ° C). That’s the flame’s heatmost part. In the blaze the colour is yellow, orange and eventually red.The fundamental difference is that combustion is heating and no flames are created because much of the energy is converted to light energy in burning, resulting in less heat energy compared to combustion. If a flame is created in a combustion process it is referred to as burning.Many things, such as magnesium, catch fire when heated in the air, and burn with a sparkling white flame. Likewise, when a piece of paper is brought near a burning candle, it burns, creating heat and light.
Presence of a combustible substance.Presence of a supporter of combustion.Heating the combustible substance to its ignition temperature.The presence of fuel plays an important role.The presence of air or oxygen.Ignition temperature is maintained (it is defined as the substance that catches fire at its lowest temperature).Solid Fuels – Examples are wood and coal. These are used to cook food in homes. Coal is also used in industries.Liquid Fuels – Examples are kerosene and petrol. Kerosene is used in stoves and in lamps to cook food and petrol is used as a fuel in automobiles.Gaseous Fuels – Examples are natural gas and petroleum gas. These are used in industries. CNG is used to run automobiles.Burning of coal and diesel releases sulphur dioxide gas. It is an extremely suffocating and corrosive gas. Moreover, petrol engines give off gaseous oxides of nitrogen. Oxides of sulphur and nitrogen dissolve in rain water and form acids.Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic air pollutant produced largely from vehicle emissions.Fuels like wood, coal, petroleum etc, which are carbon fuels produce unburnt carbon particles, which cause respiratory diseases and skin diseases.Generally CO2 is released during burning of fuels. It causes the rise in the temperature of the atmosphere of earth, which is called global warming.Incomplete combustion of fuel releases many poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide. It can kill people sleeping in a room by causing suffocation.Combustion of coal and diesel generates sulphur dioxide. It can kill people sleeping in a room by causing suffocation.Burning of fuel releases oxides of nitrogen and sulphur. They dissolve in rain water and form acid. Such rain is called acid rain.

“Biodiversity conservation refers to the protection, upliftment, and management of biodiversity in order to derive sustainable benefits for present and future generations.”Table of ContentsBiodiversity conservation is the protection and management of biodiversity to obtain resources for sustainable development.Biodiversity conservation has three main objectives:Also Read: Biodiversity in Plants and AnimalsLet us have a detailed look at biodiversity and its conservation notes to explore the strategies and concepts of biodiversity conservation.Biodiversity refers to the variability of life on earth. It can be conserved in the following ways:In-situ conservation of biodiversity is the conservation of species within their natural habitat. In this method, the natural ecosystem is maintained and protected.The in-situ conservation has several advantages. Following are the important advantages of in-situ conservation:Certain protected areas where in-situ conservation takes place include national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves.These are small reserves maintained by the government. Its boundaries are well demarcated and human activities such as grazing, forestry, habitat and cultivation are prohibited. For eg., Kanha National Park, and Bandipur National Park.These are the regions where only wild animals are found. Human activities such as timber harvesting, cultivation, collection of woods and other forest products are allowed here as long as they do not interfere with the conservation project. Also, tourists visit these places for recreation.Biosphere reserves are multi-purpose protected areas where the wildlife, traditional lifestyle of the inhabitants and domesticated plants and animals are protected. Tourist and research activities are permitted here.Also Read: National Parks And SanctuariesEx-situ conservation of biodiversity involves the breeding and maintenance of endangered species in artificial ecosystems such as zoos, nurseries, botanical gardens, gene banks, etc. There is less competition for food, water and space among the organisms.Ex-situ conservation has the following advantages:Also Read: Difference between a wildlife sanctuary and national parkFollowing are the important strategies for biodiversity conservation:It is believed that an area with higher species abundance has a more stable environment compared to an area with lower species abundance. We can further claim the necessity of biodiversity by considering our degree of dependency on the environment. We depend directly on various species of plants for our various needs. Similarly, we depend on various species of animals and microbes for different reasons.Biodiversity is being lost due to the loss of habitat, over-exploitation of resources, climatic changes, pollution, invasive exotic species, diseases, hunting, etc. Since it provides us with several economic and ethical benefits and adds aesthetic value, it is very important to conserve biodiversity.Also Read: BiodiversityFor more information on biodiversity and its conservation, keep visiting BYJU’S website or download the BYJU’S app for further reference.Biodiversity refers to the variety of plants and animals found on earth.

Reproduction is the process of producing individuals of the same kind. Most organisms reproduce by mating, which increases the genetic variability of the organism. The males and females have separate reproductive organs known as gonads. These gonads produce gametes that fuse together to form a single cell called the zygote.Few animals such as earthworms, snails, slugs, etc. are hermaphrodites and possess male and female reproductive organs in the same organism.Also Read: ReproductionTable of ContentsDepending on the number of parents involved, there are different modes of reproduction. In animals is two types of reproduction:Also Read: Modes of ReproductionLet us go through the following reproduction notes to explore sexual and asexual reproduction in animals.The process in which the male and female gametes fuse together to form a new individual is called sexual reproduction. Let us have a brief account of the human reproductive organs and their role in reproduction.Also Read: Sexual ReproductionThe male reproductive organs comprise a pair of testes, sperm ducts, and a penis. The sperms are produced by the testes. The sperms are very small in size with a head, a middle piece, and a tail.The female reproductive organs comprise a pair of ovaries, oviducts, and the uterus. The eggs (ova) are produced by the ovaries. The development of the baby takes place in the uterus. A mature egg is released into the oviduct every month.Process of Sexual Reproduction in AnimalsThe semen contains millions of sperm. A single sperm fuses with the ova during fertilization. The nuclei of the egg and the sperm fuse together to form a single nucleus. Thus, a zygote is formed.Fertilization is of two types:The fertilization that takes place inside the body of the female is known as internal fertilization. For eg., humans, cows, dogs, etc. This method is more prevalent in terrestrial animals. However, some aquatic animals also adopt this method. This may take place by direct introduction of sperms by the male in the female reproductive tract, or the male deposits the sperms in the environment which is picked up by the female in her reproductive tract.There are three ways by which offspring are produced by internal fertilization:Oviparity– The fertilized eggs are laid outside, where they receive nourishment from the yolk.Ovoviviparity– The fertilized eggs are retained in the female’s body where they receive nourishment from the yolk. The eggs are laid right before they are hatched.Viviparity– The offspring are born directly instead of hatching from the eggs. They receive nutrition from the mother. This can be seen in mammals.The fertilization that takes place outside the female is called external fertilization. For eg., frogs, and fish. Most fertilization takes place during the process of spawning. Environmental signals such as water temperature trigger spawning.The zygote divides repeatedly to form a ball of cells. This is known as the developing embryo. These cells differentiate into respective tissues and organs. The embryo gets implanted in the uterine wall. This process is known as implantation.When all the body parts of the embryo start being visible, it is called a foetus. The child is developed after nine months in humans.Oviparous and viviparous animals are two different groups of animals, which are classified on the basis of fertilization. The main difference between oviparous and viviparous animals are listed below:Besides sexual reproduction, the other major type of reproduction seen in the animal kingdom is asexual reproduction. This type of reproduction is mostly observed in lower organisms and unicellular microbes.It is the process in which a new individual is formed by the involvement of a single parent without the involvement of the gamete formation. The individuals produced are genetically and morphologically similar. The cells divide by mitotic division and no fertilization takes place. The division occurs very rapidly.Asexual Reproduction is of the following types:It is seen in amoeba and euglena. The parent cell undergoes mitosis and increases in size. The nucleus also divides. Two identical daughter cells are obtained, each containing a nucleus. Prokaryotes like bacteria majorly reproduce by binary fission.In this, the offspring grows out of the body of the parent. It remains attached to the parent until it matures. After maturation, it detaches itself from the parent and lives as an individual organism. This form of reproduction is most common in Hydras.In some organisms like Planarians, when the body of an organism breaks into several pieces each piece grows into an individual offspring. This is known as fragmentation. It can occur through accidental damage by predators or otherwise, or as a natural form of reproduction. In a few animals such as sea stars, a broken arm grows into a complete organism.It is a modified form of fragmentation and occurs mostly in Echinoderms. When a part of an organism, like an arm, detaches from the parent body, it grows into a completely new individual. This is known as regeneration.This is a form of asexual reproduction where the egg develops without fertilization. This process occurs in bees, wasps, ants, aphids, rotifers, etc. Ants, wasps, and bees produce haploid males. Parthenogenesis has been observed in a few vertebrates such as hammerhead sharks, Komodo dragons, and blacktop sharks when the females were isolated from the males.a) Variations: Due to recombination and crossing over, sexual reproduction brings about variations in species. Variations are essential for the individuality and evolution of species.
b) Better adaptability: Increased variability due to sexual reproduction helps in better adaptability of species.
c) Evolution: It helps in the evolution of species.
Harmful traits can be removed by the selection of better-adapted individuals or maybe not be expressed due to the reshuffling of gene pairs.Asexual:
———
1.) Single parent
2.) Offspring are genetically identical to each other and to their parent
3.) No Internal fertilization or External fertilization
4.) No gametes
5.) No mixing of hereditary materialFor more details on Reproduction in Animals,  different modes of reproduction, or any other related topics, keep visiting BYJU’S website or download BYJU’S app for further reference.

Adolescence is that time of life when a child reaches reproductive maturity. This is indicated by a number of changes occurring in the body. The process of these changes is known as puberty. It begins at the age of around 10 and lasts until the age of 19. The period of adolescence is known as the teenage.There is a sudden increase in height when one reaches puberty. Long bones grow rapidly, which results in an increase in height. The maximum height is attained by 18 years of age.Boys become muscular. Their shoulders widen and the waist becomes narrow. The girls widen below the waist and narrow at the shoulders.The boys develop a deep and hoarse voice. This happens because the voice box becomes larger. The voice of the girls is usually high-pitched.The secretions from the sweat and sebaceous glands increase at this time due to which many teenagers suffer from acne.In boys, the testes and penis enlarge and the production of sperms begin. In girls, the ovaries enlarge and start releasing matured eggs.These characters help to distinguish between a male and a female. These include:In Boys: Hair on the face and chest, hair under armpits and pubic region, deep voice.In Girls: Breast enlargement, high-pitched voice, hair under armpits and pubic region.Hormones are the chemical substances that are secreted by the endocrine glands for the proper functioning of various organs. The changes during the adolescence are controlled by the hormones.In males, testosterone starts getting released by the testes. This results in the growth of facial hair, hair in the pubic region, hair on the chest, deep voice, etc.In females, the hormone estrogen is released by the ovaries which result in the enlargement of breasts. The mammary glands also start developing on attaining puberty.For more information on Reaching the Age of Adolescence, or any other related topics, please register at BYJU’s.Related Links 
At puberty, the thickened uterine lining sheds off along with the egg in the form of bleeding known as menstruation.The first menstrual flow is known as menarche.The menstrual cycle stops by the age of 50 and is known as menopause.The menstrual cycle occurs in every 28 to 30 days.A teenager should take in a balanced diet, which includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals.Girls should eat a lot of iron-rich food for the formation of RBCs.Due to the increased activity of sweat and sebaceous glands, proper hygiene needs to be maintained, else teenagers might end up having various skin ailments.Girls should maintain special hygiene during menstruation.Physical exercise is important to stay fit and strong.One should avoid drugs during this age because this is the age when one easily falls prey to such negative stimulations.Prevention is better than cure. HIV is caused by sexual contact or contaminated needles and there is no cure to this disease till date.

Have you ever wondered why our knives need to be so sharp or why the nails we use the end with a sharp point? The answers to all these questions lie in the concept of pressure. It is the ratio of the force applied to the surface area over which the force is applied. We can define pressure as:The force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area over which that force is distributed. When a force of ‘F’ Newton is applied perpendicularly to a surface area ‘A’, then the pressure exerted on the surface by the force is equal to the ratio of F to A. The formula for pressure (P) is:P = F / A There are various units to describe Pressure some of which we will discuss further in this article.The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa).A pascal can be defined as a force of one newton applied over a surface area of a one-meter square.You may also want to check out these topics given below!Since the pressure is dependent on the area over which the force is acting, the pressure can be increased and decreased without any change in the force. The force applied to be constant if the surface becomes smaller the pressure increases and vice versa.For example, a brick sitting on a surface exerts a force equal to its weight on the object it is resting on. Now we know that a rectangular brick has a wide surface and a thin surface on the sides. By changing the orientation of the brick resting on a surface, we are effectively changing the pressure acting on the surface by the same brick. See the image below for more information.In other words, if the surface becomes smaller, the pressure becomes larger. It is for this reason that our knives and nails are so sharp. A knife distributes the force over its entire cutting edge. Sharper the edge, higher the pressure, and consequently the cutting with a sharp knife is easy. In a blunt knife, the force is distributed over its blunt surface with a larger surface area. Therefore, we need to put more force in order to cut. Therefore, a knife is best when at its sharpest.For the same reason—that is, that reduction of surface area increases net pressure—an expertly delivered karate chop is much more damaging and deadly than an open-handed slap. When you slap someone, the force you apply in slapping the surface is distributed all over the palm of your hand. In contrast, a karate chop concentrates all the force on the sides of your hand which have significantly lesser surface area than your palms. This leads to a greater application of pressure on the surface thereby rendering a karate chop is deadlier than a slap.Sometimes though, a greater surface area is also preferred. A typical drawing pin comes with one flat round end with which you push the other sharp end into the drawing board. Can you imagine how hard it would be to push a drawing pin into a board if both its sides were sharp? Since one end is flat, you can apply the necessary force easily. Similar tactics are used in skiing and surfing. By using surfboards and skis, we increase the area over which our weight acts thereby allowing us to float or glide over the surface of water or ice.

Aristotle famously represented a force as anything that causes an object to undergo “unnatural motion”. Sir Isaac Newton was one of the first scientists to study gravity and force. Any kind of force is just a push or a pull. It can be described as a push or pull on an object.Push or pull of an object is considered a force. Push and pull come from the objects interacting with one another. Terms like stretch and squeeze can also be used to denote force.
In Physics, force is defined as:The push or pull on an object with mass causes it to change its velocity.Force is an external agent capable of changing a body’s state of rest or motion. It has a magnitude and a direction. The direction towards which the force is applied is known as the direction of the force, and the application of force is the point where force is applied.The Force can be measured using a spring balance. The SI unit of force is Newton(N).In physics, motion is defined as the change in position with respect to time. In simpler words, motion refers to the movement of a body. Typically, motion can either be described as:The Force has different effects, and here are some of them.You may also want to check out these topics given below!The quantity of force is expressed by the vector product of mass (m) and acceleration (a). The equation or the formula for force can mathematically be expressed in the form of:Where,It is articulated in Newton (N) or Kgm/s2.Acceleration a is given bya = v/tWhereSo Force can be articulated as:F = mv/tInertia formula is termed as p = mv which can also be articulated as Momentum.Therefore, Force can be articulated as the rate of change of momentum.F = p/t = dp/dtForce formulas are beneficial in finding out the force, mass, acceleration, momentum, velocity in any given problem.Force is a physical cause that can change an object’s state of motion or dimensions. There are two types of forces based on their applications:Forces that act on a body either directly or through a medium are called contact forces.Examples of contact forces are:We can use the muscular force of animals like bullocks, horses, and camels to get the activities done. The frictional force is another type of contact force, which acts between a pair of a surface in contact and tends to oppose the motion of one surface over the other.Forces that act through spaces without making direct contact with the body are called non-contact forces.Examples of non-contact forces are:The force exerted by a magnet on other magnets is called magnetic force. Magnetic force and electrostatic force act on an object from a distance. That’s the reason they are non-contact forces. The strength of gravity is an attractive force that is exerted by the Earth on objects, which makes them fall to the land. The weight of a body is the force that is pulled by the earth towards the centre.Q.1) How much net force is required to accelerate a 1000 kg car at 4.00 m/s2?Solution:Given,Therefore, F = ma= 1000 × 4= 4000 NQ.2) Aimee has a toy car mass of 2 kg. How much force should she apply to the car so that it should travel with the acceleration of 8 m/s2?Solution:Known,F is Force to be applied by Aimmee = m × a= 2 Kg × 8 m/s2 = 16 Kgm/s2  = 16 N.Q.3) A hammer having a mass of 1 kg going with a speed of 6 m/s hits a wall and comes to rest in 0.1 sec. Compute the obstacle force that makes the hammer stop.Solution:Given,The acceleration is: a = (v – u)/tTherefore, a =  -60 Thus, the retarding Force, F = ma = 1 × 60 = 60 NThe line along which a force acts on an object is called the force’s line of action . The point where the force is acting on an object is called the point of application of the force. The force which opposes the relative motion between the surfaces of two objects in contact and acts along the surfaces is called the force of friction.Galileo experimentally proved that objects that are in motion move with constant speed when there is no force acting on it. He could note that when a sphere rolls down an inclined plane, its speed increases because of the gravitational pull acting on it.When all the forces acting on an object are balanced, the net force acting is zero. But, if all the forces acting on a body result in an unbalanced force, then the unbalanced force can accelerate the body, which means that a net force acting on a body can either change the magnitude of its velocity or change the direction of its velocity. For example, when many forces act on a body, and the body is found to be at rest, we can conclude that the net force acting on the body is zero.Gravity is the weakest force as its coupling constant is small in value.The strongest force is the strong nuclear force which is 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force.Basically, there are two types of forces:Some examples of force are:Stay tuned with BYJU’S to learn more interesting science topics with engaging videos!


When we throw a ball on the floor, it starts moving with some velocity. But ideally, no force should be acting in the direction of motion, and according to Newton’s first law, the ball should keep rolling, but this does not happen. Instead, the ball stops after moving a certain distance, so a force must be acting on it. We call this force “friction.”Friction is defined as the resistance offered by the surfaces that are in contact when they move past each other.Friction provides traction that is needed to walk without slipping. Friction is helpful in most cases. However, they also offer a great measure of opposition to the motion. In addition, about 20 per cent of the engine power of automobiles is consumed in overcoming frictional forces in the moving parts. In the next section, let us go through some of these factors.Friction is a force that is dependent on external factors. Following are the two factors on which friction depends:Friction is dependent on the smoothness or roughness of the two surfaces that are in contact with each other. When the surface is smooth, the friction between the two reduces as there is not much interlocking of irregularities. While the surface is rough, friction increases.Friction increases when the force is applied along with the irregularities.Friction is caused due to the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact. So, when one object moves over the other, these irregularities on the surface get entangled, giving rise to friction. The more the roughness, the more irregularities and more significant will be the friction.There are four types of friction and they are classified as follows:All four types of frictions are different from each other. For example, static friction is the friction that acts between the surfaces when they are at rest with respect to each other. In contrast, sliding friction is the resistance created between any two objects when sliding against each other. Similarly, understand the nature of different types of friction from the article below.Read more:Types of FrictionBlock A is kept on top of block B; the coefficient of static friction between A and B is 0.6 and between B and ground is 0.5. Also, the coefficient of kinetic friction between A and B is 0.4 and between B and ground is 0.3. If a force of 60 N is applied on block B, Find the acceleration of both the blocks. Mass of block A is 5 kg, and Block B is 10 Kg.Solution:The first step should always be to draw the F.B.D of the given setup:Let’s consider that both blocks are moving with the same acceleration, then A + B can be considered as a system, so the force equation in the horizontal direction will be,60–f1 = 15a —— (1)Since block B is moving over the surface, hence it is sliding friction.Therefore, in this case we will use coefficient of friction as 0.3, f1 = 0.3 × 15 × 10 N f1 = 45 N —— (2)From (1) and (2)we have, a = 1m/s2 From F.B.D of block A, f = 5.aPutting the value of a, we get, f = 5 NMaximum value of static friction between A and B = 0.6 × 5 × 10 = 30 NAs f lies within the range, the two blocks can move together with an acceleration of 1 m/s2. We can also be asked to find the maximum force applied to block B so that both blocks move together. In that case, since both blocks will move together, there will be static friction between the two, and hence the maximum value that can act is 30 N.Therefore, acceleration of B, a = 305 m/s2 = 6 m/s2For Block A,F – 45 – 30 = 10 × 6 F = 135 NSo if a force of more than 135 N is applied, both blocks will have different accelerations.Stay tuned with BYJU’S to learn more interesting science topics with engaging videos!


In physics, sound is a vibration that is propagated through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid. In this article candidates will learn about the facts and applications relating to sound.The information gained from this article will be useful in the IAS Exam.To complement your preparation for the upcoming exam, check the following links:The sound is a form of energy and is produced by vibrations. They are longitudinal and mechanical in nature. Sound waves can travel from one medium to another medium and when they do so there will be a change in speed and wavelength but not in frequency. Sound waves with the frequency in the range of (0-20 Hz) are called infrasonic waves. Sound waves with frequency range (20-20000 Hz) are called audible range. Sound waves with the frequency greater than 20000 Hz are called Ultrasonics.The speed of the sound waves is 332m/sec in air. The speed of the sound wave is minimum in gases and maximum in solids. The speed of sound waves increases in humid conditions and speed of sound increases with the rise in temperature. Sound waves can undergo reflection, refraction, and diffraction.Relative motion between source and object is called Doppler effect. And this phenomenon helpful in astronomy.SONAR( Sound Navigation And Ranging) is used to measure the depth of the sea.For more notes on UPSC Science and Technology, visit the linked article.Sound propagates through air or other mediums as a longitudinal wave, in which the mechanical vibration constituting the wave occurs along the direction of propagation of the wave. A longitudinal wave can be created in a coiled spring by squeezing several of the turns together to form a compression and then releasing them, allowing the compression to travel the length of the spring. Air can be viewed as being composed of layers analogous to such coils, with a sound wave propagating as layers of air “push” and “pull” at one another much like the compression moving down the spring.A sound wave thus consists of alternating compressions and rarefactions, or regions of high pressure and low pressure, moving at a certain speed. Put another way, it consists of a periodic (that is, oscillating or vibrating) variation of pressure occurring around the equilibrium pressure prevailing at a particular time and place. Equilibrium pressure and the sinusoidal variations caused by passage of a pure sound wave (that is, a wave of a single frequency) are represented in Figure 1A and 1B, respectively.For more related articles and information about the IAS exam and other articles, visit the links given in the table below:Related Links  


According to the CBSE Syllabus 2023-24, this chapter has been renumbered as Chapter 11.A wave is a disturbance in a medium which moves from one point to another and carries energy without a net movement of particles. It may take the form of elastic deformation or a variation of pressure.E.g. A rubber cork on the water that goes up and down when a rock falls into the water creates a ripple.To know more about Wave Particles Dual Nature, visit here.(i) Transverse WavesParticle motion is perpendicular to the direction of wave motion.  This type of wave is a mechanical wave.E.g.Light and Mexican wave in a stadium.(ii) Longitudinal wavesParticles travel parallel to the direction of wave motion by means of successive compressions or elongations. This is also a mechanical wave.E.g. Sound waves in the air.To know more about the Types of Waves, visit here.Sound needs a medium to propagate. The matter or material through which sound propagates is called a medium. When particles vibrate about their mean positions, it pushes a region of compressed air, creating a region of high pressure, followed by a region of low pressure as the particle retreats to its mean position. The sound wave propagates by compressions and rarefactions of particles in a medium. Sound propagation can be visualised as the propagation of pressure variations in the medium.To know more about the Characteristics of Sound Waves, visit here.The distance between two successive crests or troughs (or) successive compressions and rarefactions is called wavelength (λ).  The SI unit of wavelength is metre (m).The time taken by two consecutive compressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed point is called a Time period (T). The SI unit of time in seconds (s).The number of compressions or rarefactions per unit time is called frequency (𝛎).
The SI unit of frequency is Hertz. The  SI unit is Hertz (s−1)Speed (v), wavelength (λ) and frequency (𝛎) are related as v=λ𝛎The magnitude of disturbance in a medium on either side of the mean value is called an amplitude (A).
As shown in the figure below, the unit of amplitude will be the density or pressure. Distance between mean position and crest (maximum displacement).The number of compressions or rarefactions per unit time. Directly proportional to frequency.The volume or loudness of a sound depends on the amplitude. The force with which an object is made to vibrate gives the loudness.The amount of sound energy flowing per unit time through a unit area is called the intensity of sound.A sound of a single frequency is called a tone. A sound produced with a mixture of several frequencies is called a note.The richness or timber of sound is called quality. Sound with the same pitch and loudness can be distinguished based on the quality. Music is pleasant to the ears, while noise is not. However, they both can have the same loudness and pitch.Sound travels through different media at different speeds. The speed of sound depends on the properties of the medium: pressure, density and temperature.Speed of Sound: Solids > Liquids > GasesSpeed of sound in air = 331 m/s at 00C and 344 m/s at 22∘ CWhen a source emits sound with speed greater than the speed of sound in air, it creates a sonic boom which produces shockwaves with lots of energy. They produce a very loud noise which is enough to shatter glass and damage buildings.To know more about the Properties of Sound, visit here.Like light, sound also follows laws of reflection, it bounces off the surface of solid and liquid.The phenomenon where a sound produced is heard again due to reflection is called an echo.
E.g. Clapping or shouting near a tall building or a mountain.To hear a distinct echo sound, the time interval between the original and reflected sound must be at least 0.1s, as sound persists in our brain for about 0.1s. The minimum distance for obstruction or reflective surface to hear an echo should be 17.2 m. Multiple echoes can be heard due to multiple reflections.To know more about Reflection of Sound Waves, visit here.SONAR – Sound Navigation And Ranging.It is a technique that uses sound or ultrasonic waves to measure distance. The human range of hearing is 20Hz- 20kHz.What Are Ultrasonic Sounds?Ultrasonic sounds are high-frequency sounds having a frequency greater than 20kHz (inaudible range).Applications of Ultrasound(i) Scanning images of human organs
(ii) Detecting cracks in metal blocks
(iii) Cleaning parts that are hard to reach
(iv) Navigating, communicating or detecting objects on or under the surface of the water (SONAR).Sonar consists of a transmitter and detector mounted on a boat or ship. The transmitter sends ultrasonic sound waves to the seabed, which get reflected back and picked up by the detector. Knowing the speed of sound in water, distance can be measured using:   2d=v×t. This method is called echolocation or echo ranging.To know more about the Uses of Radar, visit here.The persistence of sound because of multiple reflections is called reverberation. Examples: Auditorium and a big hall.
Excessive reverberation is undesirable, and to reduce this, halls and auditoriums have sound-absorbing materials on the walls and roofs.  E.g. Fibreboard and rough plaster.To know more about Reverberation, visit here.If either the source of sound or the observer is moving, then there will be a change in frequency and wavelength for the observer. The frequency will be higher when the observer moves towards the source, and it decreases when the observer moves away from the source.Example: If one is standing on a street corner and an ambulance approaches with its siren blaring, the sound of the siren steadily gains in pitch as it comes closer and then, as it passes, the pitch suddenly lowers.To know more about Doppler’s Effect, visit here.The ear is a sensitive organ of the human body. It is mainly involved with detecting, transmitting and transducing sound and maintaining a sense of balance is another important function of the human ear. The human ear includes:To know more about the Human Ear, visit here.A wave can be described as a disturbance that travels through a medium, transporting energy from one location to another location without transporting matter.The amplitude of a sound wave is the measure of the height of the wave.An echo is a sound that is repeated because the sound waves are reflected back.


William Nicholson, a British chemist, demonstrated that oxygen and hydrogen bubbles are formed when the electrodes are submerged in water and a current is passed through the water. He noticed that the hydrogen bubbles were formed at the electrode connected to the negative terminal while the oxygen bubbles were formed at the electrode connected to the positive terminal.William Nicholson discovered the electrolysis of waterWhen an electric current flows through a conducting solution, chemical reactions take place in the solution. This is called the chemical effect of electric current. Some of the chemical effects of electric current are as follows:All liquids do not conduct electricity. Nevertheless, some liquids are good conductors of electricity while others are bad conductors of electricity. Water with dissolved salts and minerals is a good conductor of electricity while distilled water is a bad conductor of electricity.The passage of electric current through a conducting solution results in chemical reactions. As a result, bubbles of gas may be deposited on the electrodes. Deposits of metal may be seen on electrodes. Changes in the colour of solutions may occur. The reaction would depend on what solution and electrodes are used.When electricity is passed through water mixed with different substances, the constituents break into negative and positive ions. These ions pass an electric current through them. The more the number of ions, the better the conductor of electricity it is.Electroplating is a process where a layer of metal is deposited on another material with the help of electricity. Based on the application, the right electrodes and electrolytes must be chosen. To deposit gold over a material, an electrolyte containing gold must be chosen. Out of the two electrodes, one electrode should be of gold, and the other electrode needs to be a material on which gold is coated.While coating copper over brass, you need a copper electrode and a brass electrode and any solution containing copper, such as copper sulphate solution. The copper electrode is made anode, and the brass electrode is made the cathode. When current is passed through the copper sulphate solution, it breaks down into ions. The copper ions with a positive charge get attracted to the brass electrode, and the sulphur ions with a negative charge get attracted to copper electrode. The amount of time taken for the completion of the process depends upon the strength of the being passed through the circuit and the concentration of the solution.Electroplating is used to extract metals from metal ores. When electricity is passed through metal ores, they get broken down into ionic lattices. This way, the metals are extracted separately. Metals such as sodium, calcium, potassium, aluminium and magnesium are obtained from their ores using this method.Electrolysis is used in the purification of metals by extracting impurities from them. The impure metal is used as an anode in the process and is dissolved in the electrolyte solution. The metal ions are deposited on the cathode during the process, and a pure form of metal is obtained here. The impurities remain in the electrolyte solution. Metals such as zinc, copper, aluminium and copper are purified this way.Electrolysis is helpful in producing some compounds, such as sodium hypochlorite.Electrolysis is used to decompose a compound into its constituents. Water can be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis.By dissolving salts in pure water, you can make it conduct electricity.Seawater contains a huge amount of salts in comparison to drinking water. Hence seawater is a better conductor of electricity, and it produces a stronger magnetic field in the wire and hence deflects the compass needle more.Electrolysis is a process which uses a direct electrical current to break chemical compounds, while Electroplating is a process that uses electrical current to reduce dissolved metal cations so that they form a coherent metal coating on an electrode.The water used in the water hoses is not pure water and is a good conductor of electricity. So, the firemen shut off the electric supply before spraying water to save themselves and other people from electrocution.Rainwater is pure water which is an insulator, but it gets mixed with air pollutants like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and forms an acidic solution, which is a good conductor of electricity. So, the compass needle shows deflection.Stay tuned to BYJU’S and KEEP FALLING IN LOVE WITH LEARNING!
Gas Bubbles are formed at electrodesMetals are deposited on electrodesChange of colour of the solution.Construct a circuit with a cell, connecting wires and an LED.Insert the free ends of the wire into a beaker of water without touching each other.If the LED glows, then it indicates that the liquid is a conductor of electricity, and if it doesn’t glow, it is an indication that the liquid doesn’t conduct electricity.The liquid is a good conductor of electricity if the brightness of the LED is high.Likewise, if the brightness of the LED bulb is low, then the liquid is a bad conductor of electricity.Electroplating is used in imitation jewellery which is made by applying a layer of gold or silver.Parts of a bicycle and motorbike are chrome plated through electroplating.Tin cans are made by electroplating tin on iron.Beams of bridges and electric poles are electroplated with zinc.Anodizing and chrome plating prevent corrosion.

According to the CBSE Syllabus 2023-24, this chapter has been renumbered as Chapter 11Metals such as copper and aluminium are good conductors of electricity, while materials like rubber and plastics are bad conductors of electricity. In the case of liquids, some liquids are good conductors of electricity, while a few are bad conductors of electricity. The water obtained from sources such as pumps, wells, ponds, and tap are not pure and contain several dissolved salts. Such water is a good conductor of electricity. While distilled water is free of salt and is a bad conductor of electricity.Passage of current through chemical solutions causes chemical reactions to take place.
Chemical effects include:Electrolysis is the process by which ionic substances are decomposed into simpler substances when an electric current is passed through them.To know more about Chemical Effects of Electric Current, visit here.Any material that allows an electric current to pass through it is known as a conductor.

formation of gas bubbles at electrodesdeposition of metals at electrodesChanges in solution colourA closed-loop path which a current take, is known as an electric circuit.When the path of the circuit is closed, the current flows through it, but when there is a break in the path (switch is open) then, the circuit is open and is not conducting.Liquids conduct electricity too, when there are salts dissolved in the liquid.Most liquids that conduct electricity are solutions of acids, bases or salts.Acids and bases are chemical substances that dissociate to form ions when dissolved in a solution. They are a good conductor of electricity because of the presence of the ions.Salts, when dissolved in water, also conduct as they release positive/negatively charged ions.Distilled water is a bad conductor of electricity because of the absence of dissolved salts and minerals.Water starts conducting when acids, bases or salts are dissolved that release ions, which conduct when a potential difference is applied.A conductor, when immersed in a solution with its end connected to the terminals of a battery, thereby completing a circuit, is called an electrode. There are usually two electrodes→ cathode (ve) and anode (+ve).An electrolyte is a solution in which the electrodes are submerged. They dissociate on the passage of electric current.The electrodes, electrolyte and battery together form the electrochemical/electrolytic cell.The process of depositing a layer of desired metal on another material by means of electricity is known as electroplating.Example: Using Copper Sulphate solution as electrolyte and copper electrodes.

According to the CBSE Syllabus 2023-24, this chapter has been renumbered as Chapter 12.The Class 8 Science Chapter 15 discusses natural phenomena: lightning and earthquakes, and the measures to be taken to minimize the destruction caused by these phenomena. Let us take a look at some important points discussed in the chapter.Objects that carry a charge by means of rubbing or other processes are called as charged objects.Like charges repel, while unlike charges attract.It is a convention to call the charge acquired by a glass rod when it is rubbed with silk positive.To know more about Transfer of charges, visit here.A device that can detect the presence of charge is called an electroscope.To know more about Electroscope, visit here.When objects lose their charge by transfer, they are known as discharged objects.The process of transferring charges from a charged object to the earth is called earthing.The process of flow of charge from cloud to cloud or from cloud to earth due to the separation of positive and negative charges is called an electric discharge.To know more about Lightning, visit here.Earthquakes are caused due to movement or collision of tectonic plates in the uppermost layer of the earth’s crust.Earth’s crust is fragmented, and each such fragment is known as a plate. These plates are constantly in motion and sometimes can collapse under one another, causing an earthquake on the surface.Boundaries of the plates on the earth’s crust are weak zones where earthquakes are most likely to occur. These are known as seismic or fault zones.Tremors deep inside the earth produce waves, which are called seismic waves.To know more about Protection from Earthquake, visit here.Learn more about natural phenomena and other related topics, including CBSE class 8 science notes, at BYJU’S.Also, ReadA device that can detect the presence of charge is called an electroscope.The Earth is made up of three different layers: the crust, the mantle and the core.An instrument that records seismic waves is called a seismograph.
Any naturally occurring calamity or physical process is called a natural phenomenon.Two destructive natural phenomena: lightning and earthquakes.A body can be charged by rubbing due to friction or by induction.The electrical charges produced by rubbing are called static charges.When objects like plastic get rubbed with hair, it acquires a charge. Similarly, a glass rod gets charged when rubbed with a silk cloth.They get charged as they gain or lose electrons, and that is why they can attract or repel the small pieces of paper depending on the type of charge they carry.Charges can be transferred through good conductors (metals) to another conducting material.The charge transfer is due to the movement of the electron from one atom to another.During thunderstorms, air currents move upwards, and water droplets move downwards. This causes the separation of charges between clouds and between clouds and the Earth.When the magnitude of charges increases, air (normally a bad conductor) starts conducting and allows the flow of electricity. This is called lightning, as this flow of charge is accompanied by bright streaks of light and sound.Outside the house: (a) Find a safe place or shelter under small trees (b) If inside a car or vehicle, stay inside with doors and windows shut (c) Stay away from metal poles (d) Do not lie on the ground. Instead, crouch with your head in between your hands.Inside the house: (a) Avoid contact with telephone and electrical wires (b) avoid bathing (c) Unplug electrical appliances.Lightning conductors help to protect buildings during lightning.They consist of a metal rod that is taller than the building, which is installed within the walls during construction. They run all the way to the earth and act as a direct passage for electric discharge during lightning.An earthquake is the sudden trembling of the surface of the earth due to a disturbance deep inside the earth’s crust.Causes large-scale damage to life and property.It cannot be predicted.The power of an earthquake is expressed in terms of magnitude on a scale. This scale is called a Richter Scale.An earthquake with a magnitude > 7 on the Richter scale is considered destructive.This scale is not linear. i.e. an increase of 2 in magnitude implies 1000 times more destructive energy.An instrument that records seismic waves is called a seismograph.It consists of a vibrating rod or pendulum that starts vibrating when tremors occur.Outdoors: (a) Find a clear spot, away from overhead lines and buildings (b) if in a car, then go to a clear spot and stay inside the car till the tremors stop.Indoors: (a) stay under a table till the tremors stop (b) Avoid staying near tall heavy objects.Structural measures: (a) in highly seismic areas, build mud houses with light roofs in order to minimize damage (b) Fix cupboards and shelves to the walls (c) During an earthquake, some buildings catch fire and therefore must have proper working firefighting equipment.

When we look at a leaf we know that it is green because light bounces off the leaf to our eyes to tell us that it is green. But what is light? Which are the sources of light from which light originated? Light is electromagnetic radiation. A particular frequency of this radiation (around 390-700 nm) is visible to the human eye. Everything that we see around us is because of light. Light is a form of energy and like all energies, it is produced from a source. In Physics, these are called light sources.There are countless sources of light, but they can all be categorized under either of the two following categories-The universe is filled with objects that emit light. Some light from these sources reaches the earth. The following things in nature have the ability to emit light:Apart from natural sources, light can be produced artificially too. The different light sources produced artificially can be put under three broad categories-When certain objects are heated to a high temperature, they begin to emit light. Both infrared and visible light is produced in the process.Example- Candle, incandescent lamp.Light can be produced by accelerating charges in a luminescent material. One common way of doing it is by passing current through the material.Example- Fluorescent tube light, electric bulbPassing electricity through certain gases at very low pressure can produce light too.Example – Neon lamp, Sodium lamp.Stay tuned with BYJU’S to learn more about light sources, electromagnetic radiation, and much more.
Natural sourcesArtificial sourcesThe Sun is the major source of light for the earth. The sun is a massive ball of fire, at the centre of which nuclear fusion produces massive energy. This energy comes out as heat and light. The light from the sun is one of the major factors behind the sustainability of life on earth.Every other star produces light too, but only a small or no amount of it reaches the earth because of the huge distance.The moon provides light as well but it cannot produce light on its own. The light that we get from the moon is the light reflected by it from the sun.Some living organisms have the ability to produce light too. It is called bioluminescence. It is the effect of certain chemical reactions within the organism. Fireflies, jellyfish, glow-worm, certain deep-sea plants, and microorganisms can be cited as examples.Certain other natural phenomena such as lightning and volcanic eruptions also emit light.Incandescent Sources:Luminescent Sources:Gas Discharge Sources:

Light is a form of energy that causes the sensation of vision.

According to the laws of reflectionRefraction is a phenomenon in which there is a change in the speed of light as it travels from one medium to another and there is a bending of the ray of light. The refracted ray obeys the following laws.The splitting of a ray of white light into its constituent colours is called dispersion.The phenomenon of bending of light around corners of small obstacles and hence it’s encroachment into the region of the geometrical shadow is called diffraction.Normal light vibrates in all directions perpendicular to the propagation of light. If the light is constrained to vibrate in only one particular plane, then the light is called polarised light. The phenomenon is called polarisation.Interference is the phenomenon of modification in the intensity of light due to redistribution of light energy in the region of superposition of two or more light waves.Also, Practice HC Verma Class 11 Chapter 17 Light WavesThe frequency of light does not change when light travels from one medium to another.The property of light waves bending as it passes around the edge of the object is called diffraction.Yes, light waves are electromagnetic waves.Opaque objects like wood do not allow light to pass through them.

According to the CBSE Syllabus 2023-24, this chapter has been renumbered as Chapter 9.Download PDFIn Class 10 Science Chapter 10 Light, the phenomena of reflection and refraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light are taught to students. Furthermore, optical phenomena in nature are examined. The reflection of light by spherical mirrors is discussed in the chapter so that their applications are studied in real-life situations.Light is a form of energy that enables us to see things. Light starts from a source and bounces off objects which are perceived by our eyes, and our brain processes this signal, which eventually enables us to see. Maxwell predicted that magnetic and electric fields travel in the form of waves, and these waves move at the speed of light. This led Maxwell to predict that light itself was carried by electromagnetic waves, which means that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.Light behaves as a:According to the concept of wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics, light exhibits both particle and wave nature, depending upon the circumstances. A phenomenon like diffraction, polarisation and interference could be explained by considering light as a wave. A phenomenon like the photoelectric effect is explained by assuming that light consists of particles called photons.When light travels from one medium to another medium it either:When light is incident on a plane mirror, most of it gets reflected, and some of it gets absorbed in the medium.To know more about Properties of Light, visit here.A medium that is polished well without any irregularities on its surface will cause regular reflection of light. For example, a plane mirror. But even then, some light gets absorbed by the surface.The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal all lie in the same plane.  Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection
[∠i=∠r]To know more about the Law of Reflection, visit here.Rectilinear propagation of light: Light travels in a straight line between any two points.We can make several observations as a result of Fermat’s Principle, which will prove useful as we explore the realm of geometric optics:Mirage is an example of this phenomenon. Sometimes, we feel like we are seeing water on the road, but when we get there, the road is dry. What we really witness is the light of the sky, which is reflected on the road. Since the air is very hot just above the road, but it is cooler up higher. Hot air expands more than cool air and is thinner, this leads to less decrease in the speed of light.Students can refer to the short notes and MCQ questions along with separate solutions based on this chapter for quick revision from the links below:Any flat and polished surface that has almost no irregularities on its surface that reflect light is called a plane mirror.To know more about Plane Mirror, visit here.If the direction of a ray of light is reversed due to reflection off a surface, then it will retrace its path.Consider a hollow sphere with a very smooth and polished inside surface and an outer surface with a coating of mercury so that no light can come out. Then if we cut a thin slice out of the shell, we get a curved mirror, which is called a spherical mirror.Focal length is half the distance between the pole and the radius of curvature.F = R/2A mirror (or any polished, reflective surface) with a curvature is known as a curved mirror.To know more about Spherical Mirrors, visit here.For objects at various positions, the image formed can be found using the ray diagrams for the special two rays. The following table is for a concave mirror.Concave and Convex mirrors are used for many daily purposes.
Example: Rear view mirrors in vehicles, lamps, solar cookers.where ‘u’ is object distance, ‘v’ is the image distance and ‘f’ is the focal length of the spherical mirror, which is found by the similarity of triangles. To know more about Mirror Formula, visit here.Distances measured towards positive x and y axes (coordinate system) are positive, and towards negative, x and y-axes are negative. Keep in mind the origin is the pole (P). Usually, the height of the object is taken as positive as it is above the principal axis, and the height of the image is taken as negative as it is below the principal axis.The size of the image can be found using the magnification formula m = h’/h = – (v/u). If m is -ve it is a real image and if it is +ve it is a virtual image.The shortest path need not be the quickest path. Since light is always in a hurry, it bends when it enters a different medium as it is still following the quickest path. This phenomenon of light bending in a different medium is called refraction.To know more about Refraction and the Law of Refraction, visit here.The refractive index of one medium with respect to another medium is called the relative refractive index. When taken with respect to a vacuum, it’s known as an absolute refractive index.When the light is incident on a rectangular glass slab, it emerges out parallel to the incident ray and is laterally displaced. It moves from rarer to a denser medium and then again to a rarer medium.Following Snell’s Law:The extent to which light bends when moving from one medium to another is called the refractive index. This depends on the ratio of the speeds in the two media. The greater the ratio, the more the bending. It is also the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence and the sine of the angle of refraction, which is a constant for any given pair of media. It is denoted by:
n = sin∠i/sin∠r = speed of light in medium 1/speed of light in medium2.The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of monochromatic light in the substance of interest is known as the relative refractive index. Mathematically, it is represented as:
n = c/v
Where n is the refractive index of a medium, c is the velocity of light in a vacuum and v is the velocity of light in that particular medium.To know more about Refractive Index Formula, visit here.To know more about Total internal reflection, visit here.When light is incident on a curved surface and passes through, the laws of refraction still hold true, for example, lenses.Spherical lenses are lenses formed by binding two spherical transparent surfaces together. Spherical lenses formed by binding two spherical surfaces bulging outward are known as convex lenses while spherical lenses formed by binding two spherical surfaces such that they are curved inward are known as concave lenses.To know more about Spherical Lenses, visit here.The following table shows image formation by a convex lens.Lens formula: 1/v = 1/u = 1/f, gives the relationship between the object distance (u), image distance (v), and the focal length (f) of a spherical lens.To know more about Lens formula and magnification, visit here.Applications such as visual aids: spectacles, binoculars, magnifying lenses, and telescopes.The power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length i.e. 1/f (in metre). The SI unit of power of a lens is dioptre (D).To know more about the Power of a Lens, visit here.The refractive index of diamonds with respect to carbon disulphide will be 1.48.The focal length of the mirror is 60 cm.The height of the image is 0.6 cm.
According to the CBSE Syllabus 2023-24, this chapter has been renumbered as Chapter 8.In science, a push or pull of an object is known as force. The interaction between two objects arises force. Force has both magnitude and direction. The strength of a force is expressed in magnitude. Force brings about a change in the direction or state of motion of a body. In Class 8 Science Chapter 11, various characteristics of force, along with the types of force are discussed.A push is a force exerted away from the body, for example, Hitting a snooker ball, or kicking a football.To know more about “Force – Pull and Push”, visit here.The force of attraction or repulsion between two magnetic bodies due to their poles is known as a magnetic force.To know more about Magnetic Force, visit here.A pull is a force exerted towards the body, for example, drawing a bucket of water from a well or playing tug of war.To know more about Force, visit here.To know more about Types of Force, visit here.To know more about Frictional Force, visit here.– Vector quantities are expressed in magnitude as well as the direction of the object. For example, velocity, displacement, weight, momentum, force, acceleration etc.
– Vectors are used to find the resultant component acting on a body.
– When multiple forces act on a body, they can be resolved into one component known as the net force acting on the object.
Example:Vectors are also useful when the force acts at an angle to the horizontal.– A force is an effort that changes the state of an object at rest or in motion.
– It can change an object’s direction and velocity.
– Force can also change the shape of an object.The state of motion of an object is defined by its velocity – the speed with a direction. Thus, inertia could be redefined as follows:
Inertia = tendency of an object to resist changes in its velocity.
An object at rest has zero velocity – and (in the absence of an unbalanced force) will remain with a zero velocity; it will not change its state of motion (i.e., velocity). An object in motion with a velocity of 2 m/s, East; will (in the absence of an unbalanced force) remain in motion with a velocity of 2 m/s, East; it will not change its state of motion (i.e., velocity). Objects resist changes in their velocity.Touch or contact is required to do most of our everyday activities. For example, lifting, pulling, kicking, pushing etc.Forces that require a touch or contact to be applied are known as contact forces. For example, muscular forces and frictional forcesThe force applied by the effort of our muscles, for example, lifting a heavy box, pulling a bucket of water or pedalling a cycle.The force of attraction or repulsion experienced by a charged body from another charged body in the same vicinity is known as Electrostatic Force.To know more about Thrust and Pressure, visit here.The pressure exerted by a fluid(gases or liquids) in a container is transmitted undiminished in all direction on the walls of the container.To know more about Fluid Pressure, visit here.The upward force exerted by a fluid on an object is known as upthrust or buoyant force.Gases exert the same pressure on the walls of the container in all directions.To know more about Atmospheric Pressure, visit here.Learn more about force and its various characteristics and other related topics, including class 8 Science notes, at BYJU’S.Also, ReadSpring force is a restoring force that tends to retract the spring back to its original position.A non-contact force is a force which acts on an object without coming physically in contact with it.Thrust is defined as quickly pushing with force.
A force is a push or a pull.The interaction between objects can change the state of the objects.The result of all the forces acting on a body is known as the net force.The acceleration of the body is along the direction of the net force.The force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces.Acts between the surface of the two bodies in contact.Type of contact force.Forces that do not need contact or that have their influence without a touch. For example, magnetic force, electrostatic force, and gravitational force.The attractive force that a body experiences towards the centre of the earth is called the force of gravity due to earth.Property of the universe, every object attracts or exerts a force on every other object.The nuclear force acts between all the particles in the nucleus. i.e., between two neutrons, between two protons and between a neutron and a proton.It is an attractive force in all cases.It is the force that keeps the nucleus intact by overcoming the enormous repulsive force between positive protons.Force acting per unit area is known as pressure.\(\begin{array}{l}P=\frac{force}{area}\end{array} \)SI unit is Pascal.Force acting on a smaller area applies more pressure than the same force acting on a larger area.Examples: Porters place a round cloth on their heads to increase surface area and reduce pressure.A sharp knife cuts better as more pressure is exerted over a smaller area.Our atmosphere extends to several kilometres above sea level. The weight of the air acts as pressure known as atmospheric pressure.The pressure in our body balances the atmospheric pressure and that is why we do not feel it.

What is the term used for chemical secretions of endocrine glands responsible for changes taking place in the body?Soln:The chemical substance secreted by the endocrine glands is called hormones. Hormones are responsible for the changes taking place in the body. 2. Define adolescence.Soln:The period which comes between the beginning of adulthood and puberty is called adolescence. In this period, the body undergoes different changes alongside attaining reproductive maturity. It starts somewhat at the age of 11 and ends at the age of 18 or 19. The period of adolescence may differ from person to person.3. What is menstruation? Explain.Soln:The process of shedding the uterine lining on a regular monthly basis is called menstruation. It starts at puberty and in the reproductive cycle of the female body. The uterus prepares itself to receive a fertilized egg on every month. Due to this, the inner lining of the uterus becomes thick and is supplied with blood to nourish the embryo. If the egg is not fertilized, then the lining of the uterus breaks down and gets released in the form of blood through the vagina. The time period for this is about 2 to 8 days every month. This monthly cycle is known as the menstrual cycle.4. List changes in the body that take place at puberty.Soln:The changes that take place at the time of puberty are as follows:a) The height and weight of the body will suddenly increaseb) The hair seems to appear in the areas such as legs, hands, face and underarmsc) In females, the enlargement of the ovary takes place and starts producing matured eggs, and on the other hand, in males, the testis grows and starts producing spermsd) In males, the shoulder broadens, and the chest becomes wide, whereas in females, the region below the waist becomes wider.e) Acne seems to appear because of the excessive secretion of oil from the skin.f) In boys, the larynx becomes prominent under the influence of hormones, and the vocal cord becomes longer and thicker, resulting in a hoarse voice.5. Prepare a Table having two columns depicting the names of endocrine glands and hormones secreted by them.Soln:6. What are sex hormones? Why are they named so? State their function.Soln:The chemical substances produced by the sex organs are called sex hormones. For example, in females, the sex hormone produced by the ovary is called oestrogen and in males, the sex hormone produced by the testis is called testosterone.Some of the functions performed by the sex hormones:Oestrogen: This hormone is responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics in females, like enlargement of breasts, development of female reproductive organs, etc.Testosterone: This hormone develops secondary sex characteristics in boys, such as the growth of beard, the voice becoming hoarse, the development of the reproductive organs, etc.7. Choose the correct option.(a) Adolescents should be careful about what they eat, because(i) proper diet develops their brains.(ii) proper diet is needed for the rapid growth taking place in their body.(iii) adolescents feel hungry all the time.(iv) taste buds are well developed in teenagers.(b) Reproductive age in women starts when their(i) menstruation starts.(ii) breasts start developing.(iii) body weight increases.(iv) height increases.(c) The right meal for adolescents consists of(i) chips, noodles, coke.(ii) chapati, dal, vegetables.(iii) rice, noodles and burger.(iv) vegetable cutlets, chips and lemon drink.Soln:a) (ii) proper diet is needed for the rapid growth taking place in their body.b) (i) menstruation starts.c) (ii) chapati, dal, vegetables.8. Write notes on—(a) Adam’s apple.(b) Secondary sexual characters.(c) Sex determination in the unborn baby.Soln:a) Adam’s apple: In human males, the larynx grows larger at the time of puberty and can be seen as a protruding part of the throat. This protrusion is known as Adam’s apple. In boys, under the influence of sex hormones, the larynx becomes prominent. Due to this, the vocal cord becomes thicker and longer, which causes the voice to be hoarse. On the other hand, in females, the larynx is small and hardly visible. Therefore, girls have a high-pitched voice while boys have a deep voice.b) Secondary sexual characters: Characters which usually appear during the phase of puberty are called secondary sexual characteristics. These are the features that help distinguish the male and female bodies from each other.
Characteristics seen in males: Hoarseness of voice, the appearance of beard, broadness of chest, growth of hair in genital areas.
Characteristics seen in females: Start of the menstrual cycle, growth of breasts, growth of hair in the genital areas.c) Sex determination in the unborn baby: The sex of an unborn baby depends upon the pair of sex chromosomes that are present in the cells of the baby.
X and Y chromosomes are the sex chromosomes in humans. Ovum always contains X chromosome, and male sperm may carry either the X chromosome or Y chromosome. Male genetic make-up is 44 autosomes + XY chromosome, and female genetic make-up is 44 autosomes + XX chromoses.9. Word game :Use the clues to work out the words.Across3.

According to the CBSE Syllabus 2023-24, this chapter has been renumbered as Chapter 3.Energy can be extracted from natural resources in many forms, and it can be transferred from one body to another in the form of heat or work.To know more about Energy, visit here.Some different types of energies are:To know more about “Different Types of Energy”, visit here.Natural resources are the resources that are provided by the earth. Two types of natural resources are as follows.To know more about Natural Resources, visit here.Fossil fuels are the exhaustible resources that are formed from the decomposition of dead organic matter, for example, Coal and Natural gas.To know more about Fossil Fuels, visit here.Energy stored in fossil fuels are derived from decayed animals and plants that have existed for millions of years.Coal is a black-coloured fossil fuel which is extracted from the ground and is used as a fuel for different purposes.Peat is a dark fibrous fuel composed of partly decomposed plant matter. It is the first stage in the formation of coal.Under high pressure and temperature, the dead vegetation gets converted into coal. This process is called carbonisation.To know more about Formation of Coal, visit here.The four types of coals are as follows.Destructive distillation of coal is the process of heating coal in the absence of air. By-products formed in this process are coke, coal tar, ammonia, and coal gas.Coal tar is a black thick liquid with an unpleasant smell and is used as a starting material for manufacturing various substances.Coal gas is a fuel produced during the destructive distillation of coal. It is used as a fuel in many industries.Ammonia liquor or ammonium hydroxide is one of the by-products formed during the destructive distillation of coal. It is used to make fertilizers.Coke is a black-coloured substance and pure form of carbon used for manufacturing steel and extraction of metals.Extraction of oil is the process by which usable oil is extracted from the earth’s surface location.Characteristics of oil reservoirs are:The natural flow of oil is called the primary production of the oil. It can persist for days or years.The secondary process can be carried out by the process of:Crude oil is a type of fossil fuel, which is an unrefined petroleum product composed of hydrocarbons.Oil refining or fractional distillation is the process of separating liquids with different boiling points at different temperatures using fractional columns.Products and their uses:To know more about Fractional Distillation, visit here.Hazards caused due to excessive use of fossil fuels:Estimates of fossil fuel:Natural gas is a colourless, odourless fossil fuel which is transported through pipes from one place to another.To know more about Natural Gas, visit here.Natural gas stored under high pressure is known as CNG.

Other natural resources are air, sunlight, soil and water. Animals, birds, fish and plants are natural resources as well.Endemic species are those species of plants and animals which are found exclusively in a particular area.
Extinction is when a species is completely wiped out from the Earth.Once the last living individual of a species dies, the species is said to be extinct.Deforestation is the destruction of forests by cutting down trees.Deforestation leads to habitat loss for many animals.Procuring land for cultivation.Building houses and factories.Making furniture or using wood as fuel.Natural causes such as forest fires and severe drought can also cause deforestation.Deforestation increases the temperature and pollution level on the earth.It increases the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.It also reduces the level of groundwater.Drought is the lack of water in an area. Droughts can happen due to a lack of rainfall.The formation of a desert by erosion of vegetation due to harsh weather is called desertification.Human activities like deforestation and improper irrigation are also responsible for desertification of terrains.Global warming is the change of climate on a global level.Usually, average temperature increases, leading to the melting of ice caps in the poles.Excessive pollution and deforestation cause global warming.A species is a group of individuals that can breed and successfully produce fertile offspring.The paper industry is a leading cause of deforestation since they need wood pulp.Recycling paper can help in reducing the consumption of wood pulp by the paper industry.Reforestation is restocking the destroyed forests by planting new trees.Due to the threat from mankind’s indulgence, it is important for us to conserve the forest and its wildlife.Wildlife is important for us to maintain balance in nature.A wildlife sanctuary is a naturally occurring sanctuary, such as an island, that provides protection for species from hunting, predation, competition or poaching.The plants and animals found in a particular area are termed flora and fauna of that area, respectively.A national park is a park that is used for biodiversity conservation.They are developed and maintained by the Union Government.The biosphere is the part of the earth in which living organisms exist or which supports life.Biological diversity or biodiversity refers to the variety of organisms existing on the earth, their interrelationships and their relationship with the environment.Endemic species are those species of plants and animals which are found exclusively in a particular area.Biosphere reserves are areas that are protected from human intervention.These areas help in the conservation of endangered species.Project Tiger was launched by the government to protect and conserve the dwindling tiger population in the country.Several Natural parks have been associated with the project tiger initiative.Animals whose numbers are diminishing to a level that they might face extinction are known as endangered animals.An ecosystem is sum total of all the plants, animals and microorganisms in an area along with non-living components such as climate, soil, river deltas, etc.Migration is the periodic movement of animals from one place to another.It is usually done for breeding and to escape harsh climates.Migration is common in birds and fish.
